# Elastic stack (ELK) on Docker

Run the latest version of the [Elastic stack][elk-stack] with Docker and Docker Compose.

It gives you the ability to analyze any data set by using the searching/aggregation capabilities of Elasticsearch and
the visualization power of Kibana.

Based on the [official Docker images][elastic-docker] from Elastic:

* [Elasticsearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/tree/main/distribution/docker)
* [Logstash](https://github.com/elastic/logstash/tree/main/docker)
